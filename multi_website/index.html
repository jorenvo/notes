The goal of this document is to give a thorough technical
understanding of the standard multi-website feature in â‰¥v12. I will be
focusing on v12 in this document, but everything should be applicable
to v13 as well.

<h2 id="org1f11ac7"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Website selection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
What website to render is determined by <a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/9eb2875498044518bdfd8a473edb9cd174d26da5/addons/website/models/website.py#L479">get_current_website()</a>. It
matches websites based on their domain name and possibly geoip. This
is also the function that should be used when you want to determine
the website you're on in Python.
</p>

<p>
Odoo can be forced to load a specific website, regardless of the
current domain or geoip via the website selector in the frontend:
</p>

You can also do it manually with this GET parameter:
</p>

<pre class="example">
?fw=2

is logged in. See <a href="#orgb92089b">this</a> for more info on sessions.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Multi-website is implemented in a way that keeps module upgrades and
migrations easy. If a bugfix in a view is merged it makes sure that
this view change is applied to all websites. It also makes sure that
we retain the ability for a user to create a brand new, unmodified
website at all times (with e.g. an unmodified Contact Us page).
</p>

<p>
When naively duplicating views for each website you clutter the
database with a lot of unnecessary records. In most cases Odoo will
use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a> mechanism. It defers duplicating views until
necessary. Views are created without a <code>website_id</code> and rendered as
usual. When a user modifies it a website specific copy is created with
the appropriate <code>website_id</code> and the same <code>key</code>. This only happens for
writes that happen via the frontend (not in /web). With this mechanism
bugfixes to non-edited views are applied as usual and newly created
websites will contain all the necessary views.
</p>

<p>
From a technical POV this is mostly implemented in the <code>write</code> of
<code>ir.ui.view</code> in the website module, note that it will also handle:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>creating website-specific inherited views if they exist,</li>
<li>creating website-specific inactive views (used for <a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/9eb2875498044518bdfd8a473edb9cd174d26da5/addons/website/views/website_templates.xml#L299">customize_show
views</a>),</li>
<li>creating website-specific pages for these views,</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also this way new websites contain default views.
</p>

<p>
This means that it's possible there are multiple views with the same
XML ID. Since this isn't possible we instead use the <code>key</code> field as
identifiers for the views.
</p>

<p>
For unlinking a Copy-on-unlink <a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/dd40fb63b4ebdd4dd7b44c75d415e99b52d633a1/addons/website/models/ir_ui_view.py#L161">is implemented</a>. Website-specific copies
are created when a generic view is deleted from the frontend.
</p>

<p>
On top of this there is a mechanism that duplicates writes during
module updates. It's implemented in <a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/dd40fb63b4ebdd4dd7b44c75d415e99b52d633a1/addons/website/models/ir_ui_view.py#L126">_load_records_write()</a>. During a
module upgrade it will duplicate writes on views to website-specific
views. This only happens when the field on on the website-specific
view was not edited.
</p>

<p>
When views are rendered <a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/dd40fb63b4ebdd4dd7b44c75d415e99b52d633a1/addons/website/models/ir_ui_view.py#L205">filter_duplicate()</a> ensures that for each <code>key</code>
a website specific view is preferred over a generic one if it
exists. Here's an example:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="/notes/revisioned/multi_website/inheritance-d21bc7ee7c.png" alt="inheritance.png">

</figure>

<p>
The label in each node corresponds to the <code>key</code> of the view. If a
<code>website_id</code> is configured it's shown between square brackets. The
arrow defines <code>inherit_id</code>, child views will point to their parents.
</p>

<p>
When website 1 is rendered it will consist of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>website.layout</li>
<li>website.layout_logo_show [website 1] (this view can be inactive)</li>
<li>website.sale_header</li>
<li>custom.sale_header</li>
</ul>

<p>
A render of website 2 will consist of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>website.layout</li>
<li>website.layout_logo_show [website 2] (this view can be inactive)</li>
<li>website.sale_header</li>
<li>theme_treehouse.preheader [website 2]</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d3dc9a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4d3dc9a"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Mixins</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Multiple mixins are available to publish models on the website:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org611e248" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org611e248"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> website.published.multi.mixin</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
This inherits both <code>website.published.mixin</code> and <code>website.multi.mixin</code>
and is probably what you want to use in most cases. It allows records
in a model to be published on all or one website. When rendering a
QWeb view on the website make sure to wrap it in <code>website.layout</code> and
set <code>main_object</code> in the rendering context. It should be the main
record you're rendering, the website module will use this record to
make the publish/unpublish work:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="/notes/revisioned/multi_website/published_unpublished-197a5a0926.png" alt="published_unpublished.png">

</figure>

<p>
Unfortunately you need to manually check in your controllers whether
or not the record is accessible from the current website. This mixin
provides <code>can_access_from_current_website()</code> for that:
</p>

<pre class="example">
from werkzeug.exceptions import NotFound
# ...
if not record.can_access_from_current_website():
    raise NotFound()
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcb37d58" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcb37d58"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> website.published.mixin</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
This makes it possible to publish/unpublish your model through
<code>website_publish_button()</code>. It only supports publishing your record on
all websites. Records using this will also be publishable from the
website via the toggle.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org77ae687" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org77ae687"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> website.multi.mixin</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
In practice this only provides a <code>website_id</code> field and the
<code>can_access_from_current_website</code> function.  Use this if you want to
restrict the visibility of records in a model to one specific website,
but you want to handle this manually via
<code>can_access_from_current_website()</code> in a controller manually and you
don't want users to be able to publish/unpublish these records
themselves via the frontend.

<div id="outline-container-org3de56c6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3de56c6"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Themes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Themes are complex, they have both upstream and downstream
dependencies. An upstream dependency is a module the theme directly or
indirectly depends on. E.g. <code>theme_common</code>, <code>theme_loftspace</code> and
<code>theme_beauty</code> for <code>theme_beauty_sale</code>. Downstream dependencies are
modules that depend on it. It's also worth noting that themes can
depend on other themes, as shown above. Themes can activate optional
features on the website by activating <code>website_sale</code> views
(e.g. <code>website_sale.categories</code> to activate eCommerce
categories). Themes also have their own <code>ir.attachment</code> records which
contain default images and themes that depend on them can modify
them. Lastly, themes are often auto-installed (e.g. <code>theme_*_sale</code>
modules when <code>website_sale</code> is installed).
</p>

<p>
It leads to complex scenarios. Imagine theme B depends on theme A. The
user has installed theme A on website A and theme B on website B. If
theme A is uninstalled on website A it cannot be fully removed because
it would break website B.
</p>

<p>
Because of this themes are handled in a special way. Relying on only
COW is too complex so instead data related to themes is stored in
template models:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>theme.ir.ui.view</code></li>
<li><code>theme.ir.attachment</code></li>
<li><code>theme.website.menu</code></li>
<li><code>theme.website.page</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
When themes are installed these template models are converted to their
normal counterparts with <a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/dd40fb63b4ebdd4dd7b44c75d415e99b52d633a1/addons/website_theme_install/models/theme_models.py#L36">_convert_to_base_model()</a>. Each one of these
will have a <code>website_id</code> and a <code>theme_template_id</code> to link them back
to the theme.
</p>

<p>
You can upgrade a theme on all websites with <code>odoo-bin -u</code> or upgrade
a theme on only one website via the backend, by going to the
appropriate url.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb92089b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb92089b"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Sessions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Sessions are based on <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.16.x/contrib/sessions/">Werkzeug sessions</a>. When a user visits Odoo a
session cookie is created and stored in their browser. It's a unique
ID that links every requests that browser makes to a session in
Odoo. The session is persistent and is written to disk (by default
<code>~/.local/share/Odoo/sessions/</code>). This contains data that needs to
persist (e.g. whether or not the user is logged in). The session files
are pickled, if you want to inspect them use:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python3 -m pickle ~/.local/share/Odoo/sessions/werkzeug_861d25cb*.sess
</pre>

<p>
Stale sessions are automatically removed. A session is considered
stale if it hasn't been modified for one week. The expiration date for
the cookie on the browser side is 3 months. This is why after 3 months
you need to login again.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org39f96e2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org39f96e2"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Assets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
JS and SCSS assets in Odoo are compiled, minimized and combined into
asset bundles. In the case of SCSS it's a necessary step; it needs to
be compiled to CSS for the browser to understand. But this is not the
only reason, reducing the number of files the browser needs to load
also reduces the amount of HTTP requests. On top of that the
minimization reduces the filesize which speeds up each HTTP
request. To skip the minimization and bundling you can use
<code>?debug=assets</code>. It's useful when working on the frontend and also
demonstrates how much faster the asset bundling process makes Odoo.
</p>

<p>
Each bundle is a single file, saved as an <code>ir.attachment</code> record. You
can find them like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
SELECT id, url
FROM ir_attachment
WHERE name LIKE '/web/content%'
ORDER BY id;
</pre>

<p>
New bundles are defined in templates as regular QWEB templates and
called in the appropriate locations as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;t t-call-assets="web.assets_common"...
</pre>

<p>
This leads to <code>_get_asset_nodes</code> being called which eventually calls
<code>get_asset_bundle</code>. This creates objects that inherit from
<code>AssetsBundle</code> (like <code>JavascriptAsset</code> and <code>StylesheetAsset</code>). The
unique key of the asset is computed in the <code>checksum</code> property and is
a hash of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the metadata of the files (filename, type, url, &#x2026;) it contains, and</li>
<li>the last time a file in the asset bundle was modified</li>
</ul>

<p>
This causes recompilation of an asset bundle when a file in it changes
or new files are added. This checksum is saved in the URL of the
<code>ir.attachment</code> and looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<code>/web/content/1002-0d0afe0/web.assets_common.js</code>
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><code>1002</code></dt><dd>the <code>ir.attachment</code> ID</dd>
<dt><code>0d0afe0</code></dt><dd>the first 7 characters of the <code>checksum</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>
This leads to issues with &gt;1 website, because every website will have
its own assets. To avoid the assets constantly recompiling the
<code>website</code> module adds the website ID to the URL:
</p>

<p>
<code>/web/content/1012-0d0afe0/2/web.assets_common.0.js</code>
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><code>2</code></dt><dd>the website ID</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This allows Odoo to maintain separate compiled asset bundles per
website.
