* GMail has become slow
The [[https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17277360/gmail-redesign-live-features-google-update][GMail redesign was a while ago]]. I don't care much about the visual
changes. The main thing I dislike is how sluggish the interface has
become. Interacting with it no longer feels snappy and regularly I run
into blocking =beforeunload= handlers warning me I might lose data
when attempting to close the tab.

[[/notes/mail/gmail_archive.png]]

Since the place I work at uses GSuite and there's a lot of email to go
through in the morning I decided to stop using the GMail webclient.

The rest of this page describes my personal email setup.

* Have you accepted GNU Emacs as your lord and savior?
I have and therefore decided on using [[https://notmuchmail.org/][Notmuch]][fn:1]. It has an
official GNU Emacs client and it's simplicity makes it interesting and
fun to use and configure. Because it's pretty minimalist in it's
design an additional program is needed to synchronize your mail. The
most popular choice for this is probably [[https://www.offlineimap.org/][OfflineIMAP]].

* Approach
** OfflineIMAP
 OfflineIMAP will synchronize mail between GMail and a local
 maildir. Plenty can be found online on how to configure OfflineIMAP
 with GMail. Here's a basic configuration that downloads a couple of
 IMAP folders.

 #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
 <script src="https://gist.github.com/jorenvo/38747b3a321d629e23c081b86bc28503.js"></script>
 #+END_EXPORT

 The referenced Python file is responsible for parsing my PGP encrypted
 [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusAuthinfo][Gnus authinfo]] file. This contains the password used to connect to
 IMAP.

 #+BEGIN_EXPORT html
 <script src="https://gist.github.com/jorenvo/3b6b7689809db80374adb5490e0b495c.js"></script>
 #+END_EXPORT

 So I don't have to type my password often I set

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 # cache for 24 hours
 default-cache-ttl 86400
 max-cache-ttl 86400
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 in my =~/.gnupg= file.

** Indexing
 Now that OfflineIMAP has downloaded a copy of my mail into a local
 maildir we need to index it with Notmuch. This makes it
 searchable. Indexing is accomplished by simply running

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 $ notmuch new
 #+END_EXAMPLE

** Tagging
In Notmuch email is organized by tags. We can tell Notmuch to tag all
emails that match some search query:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ notmuch tag +inbox -archived -- folder:INBOX
#+END_EXAMPLE

This goes through all mail in the INBOX folder, removes the =archived=
tag and adds the =inbox= tag. This way we essentially put all mail in
our GMail INBOX (from here on when I refer to INBOX I mean the remote
GMail INBOX) in our Notmuch "inbox".

I try to achieve basic 2-way sync. Meaning that if I archive mail in
the GMail webclient it will sync locally as well. Hence the
=-archived=.

** Avoiding the huge INBOX of death
Notmuch does not modify your local mail[fn:2]. You may be removing
=inbox= tags from local emails but your remote inbox will never be
modified. This eventually leads to a huge INBOX.

In order to avoid this and keep our INBOX clean we can:

1. search for mail tagged with =archived= and move it to the archived
   maildir folder
2. search for mail tagged with =inbox= and move it to the inbox
   maildir folder
3. run OfflineIMAP

* Putting it all together
I implement the previous concepts in a Bash script. Whenever I want to
download mail I run the script manually.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jorenvo/7a03bdd44a32474af051fce558cc2968.js"></script>
#+END_EXPORT

The script

1. moves mail to the correct maildirs
2. runs =offlineimap=
3. removes deleted mail
4. indexes mail with =notmuch new=
5. tags mail based on what maildir folder they're in
6. tags mail low-priority mail, i.e. mailing lists

Moving mail to the correct maildirs ensures that when mail is archived
in Notmuch it's also archived remotely when =offlineimap=
runs.

Removing mail tagged with =deleted= is necessary because when
composing a draft Notmuch creates a new =draft= when saving and adds
=deleted= to previously saved drafts. This gives some sort of
rudimentary version control but as someone who saves draft mail often
often it leads to a lot of clutter.

The last steps in the script tags mail based on what maildir they're
in and their content. The =--lastmod= trick allows this tag operation
to happen quickly. Without it Notmuch would reapply the tags to all
mail. This can take a while with a large amount of mail. Every time
Notmuch makes some modification to its database it increments a
revision number. By storing the revision number before running
=notmuch new= we can make Notmuch tag only new mail.

* GNU Emacs
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jorenvo/b7e1f8907dae1a8e8e37d5a4dbfe1e89.js"></script>
#+END_EXPORT

My Emacs configuration is not very special. We have software that
sends email with non-break spaces which doesn't render nicely in
Emacs. =replace-unicode-no-break-space= replaces those with regular
spaces before displaying the message.

=notmuch-fcc-dirs= defines what folder sent mail gets put into and how
it's tagged.

Setting =notmuch-mua-user-agent-function= to
=notmuch-mua-user-agent-full= puts back the user-agent string which
removed for dubious "security" reasons. This way people know they're
nowhere near as cool as you are when they are reading your mail.

* Footnotes
[fn:1] Previously I tried out [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][mu]]. It was okay but I wanted to try
something different.
[fn:2] Except for [[https://notmuchmail.org/howto/#sync_maildir_flags][maildir flags]].
