* Introduction
Most communication on the internet happens between an end-client and a
server with an IP address accessible from the internet. Even
applications with the explicit purpose of providing direct
communication between clients (e.g. Slack, IRC, and [[https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12381/what-does-it-mean-that-skype-is-moving-from-peer-to-peer-to-the-cloud][the most recent
Skype protocol]]) use a client-server architecture where the server
proxies (and stores) all messages.

Two end-clients talking directly to each other (peer to peer, P2P)
over the internet is not straight-forward. Due to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation][Network Address
Translation (NAT)]] it is not possible to simply start sending messages
to each other. This describes a proof of concept implementation
([[https://github.com/jorenvo/p2p_broker][p2p_broker]], [[https://github.com/jorenvo/p2p_client][p2p_client]]) written in Rust that allows a direct
connection to be set up between two clients, each behind their own
NAT.

Note this is just a proof of concept and more robust solutions
exist. Probably the most popular is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment][ICE]] which uses both [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN][STUN]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT][TURN]][fn:turn]
to set up a direct connection between clients behind NAT. This proof
of concept is most similar to ICE in combination with STUN.
* Problem
** NAT basics
Most business and residential routers will perform NAT. This means
that IP addresses they assign to their LAN clients are not usable from
outside of the LAN. The clients effectively share one IP and every
packet going out from the router to the internet will use the same
source IP[fn:masquerade]. The most common traffic happens over TCP and
UDP and in those cases the router (ab)uses the source port
fields[fn:icmp_nat]. It rewrites the source port of the packet and
stores this in a NAT table:

|-------------------+--------------+----------|
| Original src port | New src port |   LAN IP |
|-------------------+--------------+----------|
|              2456 |        19262 | 10.0.0.2 |
|              2456 |        19263 | 10.0.0.3 |
|-------------------+--------------+----------|

When the router receives a reply back it will be addressed to it's own
IP, so it looks up the destination port in the NAT table. For our
above example if it receives a packet addressed to port 19263 it will:

1. set the destination IP address to 10.0.0.3
2. set the destination port to 2456

and route the packet over the right interface.

From this it is clear that it's impossible to directly address a
client from outside the LAN using only an IP address. After the router
receives the packet, there is no way it can figure out who to forward
the packet to.

You might think that if we could figure out the appropriate NAT table
entry in the router of our destination we would be able to send
packets. This is almost true, however there are some additional things
that we have to take into account.
** NAT variations
There are different variations of NAT[fn:rfc_nat_variations]. Each
type restricts who exactly can send packets that will be routed by it.
*** Source port restricted
This is the simplest type and it works as described above. When the
router receives a packet it only looks at the destination port to do
the reverse NAT.
*** Source port + destination address restricted
Here an additional column exists in the NAT table specifying the
destination IP:

|-------------------+--------------+----------+----------------|
| Original src port | New src port |   LAN IP |        Dest IP |
|-------------------+--------------+----------+----------------|
|              2456 |        19262 | 10.0.0.2 | 141.116.212.32 |
|              2456 |        19263 | 10.0.0.3 |   178.33.40.43 |
|-------------------+--------------+----------+----------------|

Whenever the router receives a packet it will not only use =New src
port=, but also =Dest IP=. Essentially it means that a client can only
receive a packet from a host if it previously sent a packet to that
host.
*** Source port + destination address + destination port restricted
This is identical to the previous one, there's just an additional
destination port column:

|-------------------+--------------+----------+----------------+-----------|
| Original src port | New src port |   LAN IP |        Dest IP | Dest port |
|-------------------+--------------+----------+----------------+-----------|
|              2456 |        19262 | 10.0.0.2 | 141.116.212.32 |     14888 |
|              2456 |        19263 | 10.0.0.3 |   178.33.40.43 |     13212 |
|-------------------+--------------+----------+----------------+-----------|

In this case the router will match 3 variables to do the routing: =New
src port=, =Dest IP= and =Dest port=. It means that a client can only
receive a packet from a host if it previously sent a packet to that
host to the port it's now replying from.
*** Symmetric
Symmetric NAT is only used for very large networks and is thus not
very common. It works differently from the other types because
multiple external IPs could be used. Because of this it's sometimes
impossible to traverse this NAT. Usually with this type of NAT a
server not behind NAT is used to relay all traffic between
clients. Depending on the exact implementation it's possible that the
below solution doesn't work for this type.
* Solution
Let's assume two clients, Bob and Alice, each behind their own NAT
(both running [[https://github.com/jorenvo/p2p_client][p2p_client]]). A server not behind NAT (running
[[https://github.com/jorenvo/p2p_broker][p2p_broker]]) is used to help set up the connection between Bob and
Alice.

Clients first register with the broker. The broker holds a list of
registered clients containing their:

- user name
- source IP
- source port

This information will allow us to traverse all above described NAT
types except /Symmetric/ in some cases.

In order to allow both of them to talk to each other the following
steps are executed.
** Individual steps
*** Bob registers
Bob sends a =REGISTER= message to the broker. This is possible because
the broker is not behind NAT. The broker will remember Bob's username,
external IP and port. 

[[/notes/nat_traversal/graphs/flow_bob_register.png]]

<<broker_can_talk_to_bob>>
Note that this message goes through Bob's NAT. This causes an entry to
be added for the broker meaning that now the broker can send messages
back to Bob.

After this, Bob sends a =LIST= command to see who else
registered. Unfortunately it doesn't return anything and Bob realizes
he's all alone.
*** Alice registers
Alice registers with the broker:

[[/notes/nat_traversal/graphs/flow_alice_register.png]]

Just like before, the message goes through Alice's NAT. This means the
broker can now reply back to Alice.

Alice sends a =LIST= command to the broker and gets back Bob's
username, external IP and port.
*** Set entry for Bob in Alice's NAT <<sec:bob_entry_alice_nat>>
Alice wants to set up a connection to Bob. The first thing she does is
send a message to Bob using the external IP and port returned by the
broker.

[[/notes/nat_traversal/graphs/flow_alice_bob.png]]

Doing this establishes an entry in Alice's NAT that allows incoming
packets coming from Bob's external IP and port.

Note that Bob will not receive the message. When it arrives at Bob's
NAT the router will drop it, as it doesn't know where to route it.
*** Ask broker to ask Bob to send a message to Alice
The last thing missing is an entry in Bob's NAT that allows incoming
packets from Alice. For this Alice will use an =ASK= message to tell
the broker to ask Bob to send a message to her. Remember that [[broker_can_talk_to_bob][the
broker can send messages directly to Bob]].

[[/notes/nat_traversal/graphs/flow_alice_broker_bob.png]]
*** Bob talks to Alice
When Bob receives the request from the broker to talk to Alice he
sends her a message. He uses her external IP and port that were
registered with the broker. The message causes an entry to be created
in Bob's NAT that will allow incoming packets from Alice. The message
will also successfully reach Alice, [[sec:bob_entry_alice_nat][since an entry allowing packets
from Bob was added before]].

[[/notes/nat_traversal/graphs/flow_bob_alice.png]]

At this point the connection is set up and Bob and Alice can continue
sending messages directly to each other.
** Full flow
For completeness here's a (quite confusing) flowchart of messages,
edges with the same number contain the same message.

[[/notes/nat_traversal/graphs/flow_full.png]]
* Conclusion
The proposed solution successfully traverses NATs to set up a
connection between two clients. It also works when clients are behind
multiple NATs, as long as none of them are symmetric. The broker will
use the IP and port of the closest NAT, but all messages described
above would flow through all NATs. So even if there are multiple a
similar type of entry is added to each one of them and the solution
still works.
* Possible improvements
** TCP
For simplicity the implementations of [[https://github.com/jorenvo/p2p_client][p2p_client]] and [[https://github.com/jorenvo/p2p_broker][p2p_broker]] use
UDP. This way connections don't have to be managed. However for
reliability reasons it would probably be better to use TCP instead.
Mostly because it would avoid having to deal with situations where
packets are lost or arrive out of order. The actual communication
between the clients that happens afterwards could still remain UDP
depending on the application.
** NAT persistence
How long an entry remains in a NAT table is implementation
specific. To ensure clients who registered remain reachable by the
broker it could send a keep-alive message at regular intervals. This
should prevent the NAT entry from being removed by the router.
** Unregister
Currently it's not possible for a client to unregister. This could be
handled in conjunction with the above. When a broker sends a
keep-alive message it could wait for a response from the client. If
the client doesn't answer the broker could unregister it.
** LAN
When two clients are behind the same NAT they are not able to
connect. When a packet is sent to the external IP of a router it
doesn't seem to route it back in using the normal NAT table. One way
this could be solved is by including the internal IP in the =REGISTER=
message. When a client wants to connect to another and sees that their
external IPs match it could instead directly connect to the internal
IP.

[fn:turn] Although TURN is not peer-to-peer, it uses a server that
relays all traffic. It's usually only used when STUN doesn't work.
[fn:icmp_nat] Router manufacturers have to be creative for protocols
without a consistent port mapping, e.g. [[https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13771-10.html][ICMP]].
[fn:masquerade] This is sometimes referred to as IP masquerading.
[fn:rfc_nat_variations] This NAT classification is defined by [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3489#section-5][RFC
3489]]. It has been criticized for being overly simple, but it's good
enough for our purpose. Note that I changed the names because they're
confusing.
